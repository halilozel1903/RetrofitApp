Retrofit is a network library. Its main purpose is to seamlessly receive JSON data over the network.
Along with receiving JSON data, it can handle all exchanges between an application and a server.
Retrofit does what the Volley library does, but it's faster than Volley. like in the volley library
No JSON parser is needed to parse JSON data. All the features required for web services
It is a very powerful library.

You can read the article below about the Retrofit - Volley comparison:

# What is API ‚ÅâÔ∏è

API (Application Programming Interface) is the interface provided by the application that shares its capabilities so that the capabilities of one application can be used in another application. In this project, we have the features that YouTube API provides to developers.
We will develop an application using


# We Make API Settings ‚öôÔ∏è

First of all, we will make the necessary arrangements of the Api that we will use in our application from the link below.

https://console.developers.google.com/apis/

After entering the link, press the Activate API's and Events button to select the type of API to be used in the application.
We are directed to the page we will choose. By selecting the application to be used, we click on the option to try the application below.

In the example we will use in our application, we will get the id value of any channel and reach its playlists. We use the snippet option. It allows us to access all the information on the channel. We have specified the maximum data we will pull from the channel.

You can see how we can enter the video lists of any channel and get the id value in the picture below:

After performing the above operations, we start the process by pressing the **Excute** button below.

```java 
 GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlists?part=snippet&channelId=UC9IGkktBTEgUKzdWL_x2uUA&maxResults=15&key={YOUR_API_KEY}
```
 <br>
 
He gave us a url to use in the application. We will use the API KEY value belonging to the application in our project.

In the picture above, an API KEY value of the application is given. You will use that value. The app has no restrictions
We mark as. If you want to throw your application to the Play Store, you should only select the Android Applications option.
